# Kari

This website called Kari is a practice project for HTML, CSS and JS. It is an unfinished project for various reasons but it contains several working parts. The whole website is responsive, it has a main page and a few subpages, such as a functional login / register modal (created with Firebase, wihtout the email verification), a user specific profile page. The site's purpose is to help people with buying useful gifts for each other by creating user friendly, family specific databases. This process of the page is unfinished, it only contains dummy content and the user interface of the data creation process.

A believe that this project shows that I have a strong basic knowledge of the two fundamentel part of front end development. I love to create great designs but in this particular project I was never aiming towards making it more 'holidayish' even if it's built around a christmas orianted subject.
